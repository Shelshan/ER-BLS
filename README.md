# ER-BLS
This project includes the python code of braod learning system fuse with CNN based on transfer learning for facial beauty prediction(FBP), and two benchmark datasets, such as SCUT-FBP5500, SCUT-FBP. Welcome to use and reference our papers. Get datasets: SCUT-FBP5500 and SCUT-FBP. Please refer to our paper "Facial beauty prediction fusing transfer learning and broad learning system" and "TransBLS: transformer combined with broad learning system for facial beauty prediction" for more details.
